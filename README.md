##Product Mix Optimization with Linear Programming

##This project demonstrates how to solve a classic product mix optimization problem using linear programmimg in Python with the PuLP library. It also includes a visualization of the feasible region and insights based on the optimal solution.

##Problem Statement

##A factory produces two products

##Product A: Requires 2 hours on machine 1, 3 hours on machine 2 and has a profit of $30/unit.

##Product B: Requires 4 hours on machine 1, 2 hours on machine 2 and has a profit $50/unit

##Machine Availability(per week): Machine 1: 100 hours, Machine 2: 90 hours.

##Objective is to maximize total profit without exceeding available machine hours.

##Solution Approch: Formulate the problem as LP model, Define decision variables, objective functio, and the constraints. Then solve the LP using PuLP and the CBC solver. Also visualize the feasible region and highlight the optimal solution.

##Using Jupyter notebook the problem is solved.
